			<ul class="content-text">
				<li>All the parts needed for one (1) cool project.</li>
				<li>
					A booklet with:
					<ul>
						<li>Instructions for building said project.</li>

			<h4>Get stuck? Ask for help.</h4>
			<p class="content-text">When you buy a kit, you also buy discounted access to one-on-one tuition sessions with one of our experienced mentors. Ask us anything, and we'll try out best to help you through it, though we'll probably have better performance rates with one of our kits.</p>
			<p class="content-text">Don't want to buy a kit? No problem. You'll still have access to our mentors, though without a discount.</p>
			<p class="content-text">Poor student, underpaid indentured servant to the state, or just looking for a side gig in general? <a>Join us</a> as a mentor and receive majority of the mentorship fee for each session!</p>

			<h4>Avoid double-buying: keep track of your inventory.</h4>
			<p class="content-text">We get that there is a lot of overlap in the parts lists of our kits; after all there is so much an Arduino can do. So, if you create an account, we'll keep track of what you have ordered for you and you can use our parts picker to pick out only what you need for your new kit.</p>

		<div class="content odd">
			<h4>Got an amazing idea for a new project? We'll pay you!</h4>
			<p class="content-text">Our line-up of projects cannot always remain stagnant. If you have an idea for this amazing project you're dying to see in kit form, write to us and we might just buy the idea from you and turn it into the latest in our lineup! Bonus points for having written a lesson nice and ready to hit the presses and stuff in boxes just in time to slap some stamps on.</p>
