# Arduino Learning Platform

A joint project between me and a friend. I focused on design and the frontend, but helped with some backend work. As the website is currently offline, it still can be found on Internet Archive (though slightly buggy) at `kits.foundrycollective.io`. The representation is in this [file]("/representation.pdf").
